# Team Summary

Hieu and Michael split up the work and collaborate via GitHub. Hieu works on the login, register, customer and booking agent use cases. Michael works on the public info and staff use cases. 

The customer and agent use cases are similar, while the staff use case is a litte more complicated, so overall, the work is divided evenly.
